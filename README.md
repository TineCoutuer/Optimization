# Optimization

Matlab code for optimizing truss struture. See figure below for the parameters.

## To use the code:
1. Download **optimization.m, structural_analysis.m, plot_bridge.m, objective.m** and **nonlcon.m**
2. Run **optimization.m**

**_NOTE_**: 
- The _nodes_test.m_ is a preliminary test file, so NOT used anymore!
- _optimize_plot_callback.m_ can be used to plot contour plots, but does not work well yet.
